Module 3: Lab
The purpose of this lab is to create an interactive text-based Coffee
Shop simulator that calculates a receipt based on how many items the 
user wants to order.

def coffeeShop():

    This function obtains menu-input from cusstomer, calculates pricing
    based on input, and generates a receipt, containing the total of 
    what the customer purchased.
    Also, this function follows the IPO procedure.
